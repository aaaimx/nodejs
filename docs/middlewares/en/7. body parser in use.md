# Body Parser in Use

In the previous lesson, we added the body-parser to extract the data from the incoming request bodies. In this lesson, we will implement it in our /users and /codes routes to get the desired data.

Now in our route handlers (let's say POST, where we are expecting to get data), we can read the body with the following code:

```js
router.post('/', (req, res, next) => {
  const data = req.body.sampleData;
});
```

Here the sampleData is just a random word. But it should match the property on the incoming request. So, using the code above, the body of the POST request should look like the following:

{
  "sampleData": "Random data"
}

Now let's handle the request body in /users route's POST handler: 

```js
// users.js
router.post('/', (req, res, next) => {
  const user = {
    name: req.body.name,
    age: req.body.age
  };
  res.status(201).json({
    message: 'Handling POST request of the /users',
    user: user
  });
});
```


Now let's write the body and see the response:

Let's do the same for /codes: 
```js

// codes.js
router.post('/', (req, res, next) => {
  const code = {
    language: req.body.lang,
    data: req.body.data
  };
  res.status(201).json({
    message: 'Handling POST request of the /codes',
    code: code
  });
});
```

The Postman request will look like this:

> So, we successfully handled two requests with different bodies to two routes and got the results.

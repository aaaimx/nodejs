# Status Codes

So far, we've built the base of our routes; however, it is not a good practice to use only the status code 200 (OK) for all the responses.

In general, [HTTP status codes](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/) are divided into five categories, but now we only need one: 2XX codes.

For now, there is only one status code that we need to change: the one for our POST route. The HTTP status code 201 is used whenever a resource is created inside a collection. So, let's go back to the users.js file and edit the status code: 

```js
// users.js
router.post('/', (req, res, next) => {
  res.status(201).json({
    message: 'Handling POST request of the /users'
  });
});
```
 
Note that the status is **201** at the image above.


Let's send a POST request using Postman and see the result.
**POST Request: localhost:3000/users**

> From now on, we will only use the correct status codes for each response, where the most common ones are 200, 201, 404 and 500.

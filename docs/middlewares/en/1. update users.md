# Update Users

Let's complete our **/users** routes with **PATCH** and **DELETE** requests.
Again, we need a specific user for those actions, so we need to use "userID" in routes. This will help to modify the user by its unique ID.

So, the **PATCH** method will be:

```js
// users.js
router.patch('/:userID', (req, res, next) => {
  const id = req.params.userID
  // find and update user by id
  res.status(200).json({
    message: 'User updated!'
  })
})
```

The **PATCH** request method applies **partial modifications** to a resource. The HTTP PUT method only allows complete replacement of a document. **PATCH** is not idempotent, meaning successive identical patch requests may have different effects.

And the **DELETE** method:

```js
// users.js
router.delete('/:userID', (req, res, next) => {
  const id = req.params.userID
  // find and delete user by id
  res.status(200).json({
    message: 'User Deleted!'
  })
})
```

Let's start/restart the server and quickly test the new methods with Postman:

**PATCH Request: localhost:3000/users/admin**

**DELETE Request: localhost:3000/users/1234**

> It is a good practice to test each new route just after the creation to avoid unexpected errors later.

# Codes Route

For now, we have completed our dummy users route, let's build the codes route from what we learned so far. You can go back to the introductory lesson to see the requirements of the **/codes** route.

> Try to implement **/codes** route by yourself before continuing the lesson. Don't forget that in addition to the /routes/codes.js, you also need to make some changes in the app.js file to handle all the **/codes** route requests.


If you don't have the /api/routes/codes.js file in your project, then create it and follow the instructions below.

```js
// codes.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {});
router.post('/', (req, res, next) => {});
router.get('/:codeID', (req, res, next) => {});
router.patch('/:codeID', (req, res, next) => {});
router.delete('/:codeID', (req, res, next) => {});

module.exports = router;
```

And here are the changes in the **app.js** file: 
```js
// app.js
...
const codesRoutes = require('./api/routes/codes');
...
app.use('/codes', codesRoutes);
```
> For now, both users and codes are very similar. But when we start using Database, you will see the differences.

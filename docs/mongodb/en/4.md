## What is Mongoose?

**Mongoose** is an intermediary between MongoDB and the server (Node.js), which makes interactions with a database (create, read, write, etc.) very simple.

In other words, as it mentioned on their [official website](https://mongoosejs.com) : "Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in typecasting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box."

By default, it supports an asynchronous environment, so you can use its module methods just like any other tools in Node.js.

You can find additional information about their npm package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose).

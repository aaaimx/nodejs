# Model for Codes
We need to create a new model for the code, just like the model we created for the user.
Overall, it is similar except for the schema itself.
```js
  //models/code.js
  const mongoose = require('mongoose');
  
  const codeSchema = mongoose.Schema({
       _id: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
       language: String,
       body: Striing
  });
  
  module.exports = mongoose.model('Code', codeSchema);
```
This will work fine for now. However, we need some relation in our code schema to link the document to a user.
So , how we will know which code is created by which user(the owner of the code)?

For that we need to add a new field in our schema, which will take the user ID referenced to the user model.

```js
user:{ type : mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }
```
> if you're using lots of relations in your schema, then you may switch to a SQL-based database such as Mysql or PostgreSQL

# RESTful API with Node.js and Express

We are going to build a **RESTful API** using Node.js and a framework called Express. Later, we will add a database to our API so the data will be available after restarting the server. Also, we will add protection to our routes and requests, to let only authorized users access different parts of the API.

In course, you will learn:
• What **Express** is
• How to create an API with Express
• What **MongoDB** is
• How to store data in MongoDB
• What **JWT** is
• How to protect routes with JWT

Here is a simple diagram of what our API would be.

In the image above, each yellow box displays a route with the available methods in it. The ones surrounded by red lines will be protected with JWT.

Each of the technologies mentioned above - **Express**, **MongoDB** and **JWT** - will be explained during this series separately. So, there are no prerequisites for them except Node.js itself.

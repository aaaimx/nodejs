# Get User By ID js

Now we want to get a single user's data by their ID. Again we are going to use a GET request, but in this case, the route should be dynamic. For example, '**/users/1234**' or '**/users/admin**' etc. We want to process all such routers in a single handler.

For that we need to use a **placeholder** in the URL called **request parameter**. Express provides request parameter extraction by using **req.params**. The following code uses '**:userID**' in the route and extracts it inside the callback.
```js
// users.js
router.get('/:userID', (req, res, next) => {
  const id = req.params.userID;
});
```

So, here the userID is a placeholder for request parameter variable (indicated by : (colon) ), which is accessible from **req.params.userID**. You can use any valid name for request parameter variables.

Now let's handle the ID. For example, let's check the userID against the 'admin' value and respond properly.
```js
// users.js
router.get('/:userID', (req, res, next) => {
  const id = req.params.userID;

  if (id === 'admin') {
    res.status(200).json({
      message: 'You are the Admin!',
      ID: id
    });
  } else {
    res.status(200).json({
      message: 'You are a standard user',
      ID: id
    });
  }
});
```

Here, we compare the ID with the string 'admin' and return a custom message like we did before and respond with a different one in other cases. 

Now, let's try our newly built router with different parameters with Postman:
**GET Request: localhost:3000/users/admin**

**GET Request: localhost:3000/users/1234**

>!Don't forget to **start/restart** your server before testing it with Postman!

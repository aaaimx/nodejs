# Making API Requests js

In the previous lesson where we started the server on our localhost, we didn't send/receive any request/response from the server. So, let's see the different methods to interact with the server.

### Browser
In this case, where you are not passing any values with the request you can use the browser's URL to send a GET request: localhost:port.

### Postman
**Postman** is a powerful tool to send any type of a request to the server with the ability to set and alter all the parameters of the request. For example, you can set a JSON body with some authentication headers, etc.

### CURL
**CURL** is a powerful command line tool and library 
for transferring data with URLs.

In the case of a simple GET request, we can use the browser. If you enter localhost: followed by the port (in this case 3000) "**localhost:3000**", you will get the following response in the browser:

"image browser in localhost:3000"

As specified in the previous lesson it returned the JSON object with message key and value "Hello World!".

The same request with Postman would be:

"image in postman get route"

 
As you can see, Postman returns much more detailed data of the request such, as the status code, how long the request takes and the output in a nicely formatted JSON.
```
Feel free to play with Postman parameters and see different types of responses it supports. You can find the software and their documentation here. Note that, throughout the course, all of the examples will come with Postman screenshots.

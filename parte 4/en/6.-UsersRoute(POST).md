# Users Route (POST) js

Now that we have the necessary setup in app.js file, we can add as many routes as we want in the users.js file. So, let's write the **POST** request handler.

It is similar to the GET request with some minor differences:
```js
// users.js
router.post('/', (req, res, next) => {
    res.status(200).json({
        message: 'Handling POST request of the /users'
    });
}); 
```

Don't forget to export your router so the app.js file can access your users.js file:
```js
// users.js
module.exports = router;
```

Now that we have our **GET** and **POST** routes, let's try sending a request with the Postman.
Don't forget to restart your server to apply the changes. For that, you can kill the server by pressing Ctrl+C key combination and start it again with ($ **node server.js**) command.

**GET Request: localhost:3000/users**

**POST Request: localhost:3000/users**

>!Notice that you can no longer send a request to the **root route** (localhost:3000) as there are no handlers for that. Also, as the users' routes are specified, it will only accept the GET and POST request and fail (return an error) on any other types.

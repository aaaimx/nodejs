# Users Route (GET) js

We need to have all our API-specific things, such as **routings**, in one place. So let's create an '**api**' directory and a subdirectory of 'routes', where we will keep our '**codes.js**' and '**users.js**' files. So, the **structure** is the following:
```
.
├── api
│      │
│      └── routes
│               ├── codes.js
│               └── users.js
├── app.js
├── package.json
└── server.js
2 directories, 5 files
```

Now that we have the **api/routes/users.js** file, let's create our first user route (GET) which will return all the users. The file api/routes/users.js file will contain all the routes related to users. 

Open the api/routes/users.js file and import the 'express' module. We need to call the **Router()** method on the Express instance in order to use routing functionalities:

```js
// users.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
```

Now, we need to use the router to implement API request handlers for the user **resource**.

```js
// users.js
router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    message: 'Handling GET request of the /users'
  });
});
```

**get()** is a method which takes two arguments. The first one is the **URL** and the second argument is the **handler** function. There is nothing new in the body of the handler, where it responds with the status of 200 in a JSON format with a custom message.

>!Notice that the first argument of the get() method is URL, and we are just using a slash (/). But we want our route to be /localhost:3000/users/. For that, we need some modifications in the app.js file.

# Express.js Project Setup

**Express.js** is a popular web framework written in JavaScript. This module's job is to ease the development process and help you set up your API.

It can be installed using: $ **npm install express --save**
To use it in a module, you need to import and call it as a method like the following:
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
```

It is possible to write an API without using any framework (pure Node.js). However, it is recommended to use a stable framework to have an easily maintainable API that provides minimal boilerplate code.

To setup a project, create a directory and initialize the node project ($ **npm init**). You can leave the options as they are during initialization, and if you need to, change them later from the **package.json** file.

In the end, our project will have the structure described below.
```
.
├── api
│      ├── middleware
│      │      ├── check-auth.js
│      │      └── query-validator.js
│      ├── models
│      │      ├── code.js
│      │      └── user.js
│      └── routes
│               ├── codes.js
│               └── users.js
├── app.js
├── package.json
└── server.js
4 directories, 9 files
```

In your project directory, type **npm install express --save** in the terminal to install the Express framework. Then add the **app.js** and **server.js** files in the projects main directory.


>!Check your package.json file after running the command above to verify that the express module was installed. Note that the node_modules directory is also created.

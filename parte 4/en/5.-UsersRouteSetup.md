# Users Route Setup js

We already added our GET route in the users.js file, but we need to fix a few things.

We know that our base URL is **localhost:3000**, and everything inside the users.js file should be under the **localhost:3000/users**, so let's set it from the app.js file where it will handle all the incoming requests from the users.js route by attaching a /**users** before the path itself.

First, import the users.js inside the app.js file:
```js
// app.js
const usersRoutes = require('./api/routes/users');
```

Now, let's modify the **app.use()** method to receive the **usersRoutes** requests and attach the prefix URL (path):
```js
// app.js
const usersRoutes = require('./api/routes/users');
app.use('/users', usersRoutes);
```

>!Note that if in users.js we write our GET route like: '/**users**/' instead of '/' then our full route will be: **localhost:3000/users/users**, which is **not** the desired naming.

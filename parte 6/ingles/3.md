## Install and Setup MongoDB

In this lesson, we are going to setup MongoDB on our system. You can find the official installation guide here.

After the installation, you can use the following command to start the **mongod** server: 

    $ sudo service mongod start 

To shut down the server: }
        
    $ sudo service mongod stop 


And finally to restart the server: 
    
    $ sudo service mongod restart 


To start a mongo shell on the same host machine as the mongod, use the **--host** command line option to specify the localhost address and port that the mongod listens on. For example: 

    $ mongo --host 127.0.0.1:27017 

>By default the mongod is running on 127.0.0.1:27017 (localhost:27017) and you can use it to create your DB with tools like Mongoose.
